# I want to use TRPC with Clerk authentication (T3 Stack)

- [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## Manually added

- [Clerk](https://clerk.com)

## The staffProcedure will not work and I cant figure out why

- I want to use the clerk auth in trpc and use it to protect routes

- If this gets resolved, I will create a YouTube video about it and I can help write docs for Clerk with TRPC (App Router)

## Getting started

Someone may be able to solve this without running the code, if not, you have to do the following to get up and running:

1) Create a postgres database (I just made a new project on SupaBase for this)
2) Add the Enviroment Variable ``` DATABASE_URL=****```
3) ```npm run db:push```
4) npm run dev
