# I want to use TRPC with Clerk authentication

# This is a T3 Stack project with Clerk authentication

- [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## Manually added

- [Clerk](https://clerk.com)

## The staffProcedure will not work and I cant figure out why

- I want to use the clerk auth in trpc and use it to protect routes

- If this gets resolved, I will create a YouTube video about it and I can help write docs for Clerk with TRPC (App Router)
